		<h1>Capon beamforming algorithm simulation</h1>

			Using the same generalized Vandermonde vector as described in the <a href="../bartlett/">Bartlett beamformer</a>, the Capon beamformer is computed. The results follow the earlier ones obtained with the Bartlett beamformer, but wit a much sharper finding of the source location.
		</p>

		<h2>Results comparison</h2>
		<p>
			The results from the Bartlett and the Capon are compared as an example here:

			<br/>
			Fig. 2: results from the Bartlett beamformer using a horn array.
			<br/><br/>

			It can be observed that the Capon beamformer does not have so many undesired "side lobes" as the Bartlett, thus offering a much "cleaner" result.
			<br/><br/>
			It is interesting to note, although, that the Capon beamformer shows a much higher "background level" as it gets closer to the array location. This has not been further studied, but it may impact the performance for close distances.

		<h2>Developed scripts</h2>
		<p>
			A single program that performs the beamforming: <a href="caponBeamforming.m">caponBeamforming.m</a>. It generates a mat file that can be plot using the same utility from the Bartlett beamforming.
